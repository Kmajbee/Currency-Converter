# Currency-Converter
It's a python program that exchanges currencies.
The point is that the program checked in the cache whether it has the exchange rates of a given currency, and if not, it checked from the website 
and then it calculates how much money we will receive from a given currency on the road.
Please enter 2 currency scruties in lowercase letters and the amount of the first currency when you give the currency with a capital letter is the program may not work
for example.
>ils,
>usd,
>45


Checking the cache...
Oh! It is in the cache!
You received 13.22 USD.
